Steps to crawl website:

1. Pick a URL from the unvisited URL list.
2. Determine the IP Address of its host-name.
3. Establishing a connection to the host to download the corresponding document.
4. Parse the document contents to look for new URLs.
5. Add the new URLs to the list of unvisited URLs.
6. Process the downloaded document, e.g., store it or index its contents, etc.
7. Go back to step-1.

Algorithm for crawling is Breadth first search and Depth first search in 
some situations.

Components required:

1. URL frontier: To store the list of URLs to download and also prioritize which URLs should be crawled first.
2. HTTP Fetcher: To retrieve a web page from the server.
3. Extractor: To extract links from HTML documents.
4. Duplicate Eliminator: To make sure same content is not extracted twice unintentionally.
5. Datastore: To store retrieve pages and URL and other metadata.
